    "# Python Lists vs NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are flexible — they can store different types of data in the same container.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "example_list = [1, 2.5, \"asdf\", False, [1.5, True]]\n",
    "example_list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility, however, introduces limitations. If we try applying an operation like \"add 1\" to every element, we must process each item one by one. Adding 1 works for numbers, but not for strings, booleans, or nested lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing we often work with huge collections of numerical values, and we need fast operations on all elements at once. This is where NumPy arrays excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a NumPy Array?\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array is a grid of values — but unlike lists, all elements share the same data type.\n",
    "Arrays are stored efficiently in memory and allow vectorized operations, meaning operations apply to entire groups of values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array has three key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute\tDescription\n",
    "dtype\tData type of all elements (arrays are homogeneous).\n",
    "shape\tDimensions of the array, e.g. (3,2), (500,), or ().\n",
    "data\tRaw memory buffer containing the stored values. Efficient and passable to C/Fortran.\n",
    "Performance Test: Python vs NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare performance inside Jupyter by creating two objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "one normal Python list\n",
    "\n",
    "one NumPy array (later)\n",
    "\n",
    "and an empty list to store results\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Python list and an empty list for results\n",
    "size = 10_000_000\n",
    "py_list = list(range(size))\n",
    "result_list = []\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can benchmark and see how much faster NumPy is for large computations."
