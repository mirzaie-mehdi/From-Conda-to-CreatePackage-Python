    "A Python **environment** is an isolated workspace that contains a specific Python version along with\n",
    "libraries, dependencies, and tools. Managing environments is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility of projects  \n",
    "- Preventing version conflicts  \n",
    "- Allowing multiple projects with different dependencies  \n",
    "- Providing a clean and controlled space for development  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several environment managers and distributions available.  \n",
    "The most popular ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conda**\n",
    "- **Miniconda**\n",
    "- **Mamba**\n",
    "- **Anaconda**\n",

    "| Feature | Conda |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Manages Python environments | ✔ |\n",
    "| Installs non-Python packages (C/C++, CUDA, R…) | ✔ |\n",
    "| Works offline once packages are downloaded | ✔ |\n",
    "| Huge scientific stack (NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter…) | ✔ |\n",
